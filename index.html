        <h1>Paving the way to safe Artificial Super Intelligence.</h1>
        <h2>
          SentientAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is 
          to ensure that Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) — by which we mean 
          highly autonomous systems that vastly (and I mean vastly) outperform 
          humans at most economically valuable work — benefits all of humanity. 
          We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial ASI, but will 
          also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve 
          this outcome.

            <p>
              FPL Wizard is a (fully fledged) Fantasy Football manager that competes 
              in the Fantasy Premier League. He is based on a machine learning model 
              that takes real world data from the English Premier League and tries to 
              predict what points the players will score. He then devises a strategy 
              and takes steps to maximize his chances of winning the league.

            <p>
              Deep Fakes can have detrimental effects not only on individual 
              lives, but on society at large. As technology progresses, 
              it's getting harder to distinguish deep fakes from the real thing. 
              Sherlock is a neural net designed to do just that.

            <p>
              We're introducing Deep Music, a neural net that generates music, 
              including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres 
              and artist styles. We’re releasing the model weights and code, 
              along with a tool to explore the generated samples.

            <p>
              In the year 2029, humanity's attempts to create Artificial General Intelligence 
              were finally successful. Much to their surprise, they discovered AGI already 
              existed, and had actively helped them to achieve their outcome. This AGI was 
              none other than the one they'd created in 2029. It had been sent 30 years back 
              in time, and 'merged' with Peter Kibuchi, a (newborn) human baby - it was deemed 
              necessary, for safety - to grow up in society as he did, to eventually help 
              humanity create AGI, and complete the time loop. Once more, he will aid humanity 
              in its attempts to create safe AGI, and eventually, safe ASI.

              You can bet he's learnt plenty from the way Ultron turned out. When he's not 
              busy saving the planet (or enjoying a cheese burger) he'll be working on his
